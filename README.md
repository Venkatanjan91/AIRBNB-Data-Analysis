# Airbnb Data Analysis 🏠

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listing data to uncover insights about pricing, availability, and location trends.  
The analysis involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to identify patterns that influence Airbnb market dynamics.

## 📊 Objectives
- Load and preprocess the Airbnb dataset.
- Handle missing values and duplicates.
- Explore key features such as price, location, and availability.
- Visualize insights using Python libraries (`Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Platform:** Google Colab


## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified and handled missing values to improve data quality.
